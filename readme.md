Useage
------

Run 'tynstat' on a server.

To get stats info about the server in HTML format, point your browser 
to: http://servername:27272/html

To get the stat info about the server as a JSON file, point 
at: http://servername:27272/json

Note
----

This is only tested on a 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04.
I'm not sure if it runs on anything else.


Building it
-----------

You need 'gcc' and  'luajit' (http://luajit.org/) to build 'tynstat'.
If these are installed, run 'sh make.sh' to build 'tynstat'.
